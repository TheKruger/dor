# dor
The dor is a tool to get documentation about a file or directory.

# Build from source

To get the binary file run the `compile.sh` and the binary file will be put to the `bin` folder.
If you on windows or mac then try to download the GCC and compile it but this tool is only tested on linux.
# How to use
First select your file or directory. For the example I create a `file.a` file. After create a file that endswith `.dor` for the `file.a`. (`file.a.dor`)
Then put some text to your `file.a.dor` file and run `./dor file.a`.
